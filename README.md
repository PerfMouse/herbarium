# About
This was a small Unity project made for a school asignment.
We had to search for plants and note them down, so I made an app for it.

It contains all the plants with two images, if you click on one, you get the option to mark it as found and give in the needed information.
Then later, you can find back a list with all the plants you've collected with the information

# Files
Only the Assets folder from the Unity project is uploaded, so in order to run it you have to copy them into a new Unity 2D project.
